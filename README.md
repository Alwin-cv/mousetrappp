Project DescriptionThis project is a playful, intentionally disruptive web application designed to demonstrate immediate visual and auditory feedback based on cursor movement. It makes sure you're always aware of your digital actions!The Problem (that doesn't exist)Modern web browsing is far too calm and predictable. Users need a constant, engaging reminder that their cursor is, indeed, moving, to prevent them from slipping into digital complacency.The Solution (that nobody asked for)By integrating a full-screen flash, a persistent pop-up alert, and a delightful frog croak on every single mouse movement, we ensure the user is perpetually aware of their subtle digital actions, thus eliminating the "problem" of overly smooth online experiences.Technical DetailsTechnologies/Components UsedFor Software:Languages used: HTML, CSS, JavaScriptFrameworks used: Tailwind CSSLibraries used: Tone.jsTools used: Any modern web browserFor Hardware:[.][.][.]ImplementationFor Software:InstallationNo specific installation steps are required beyond having a modern web browser.RunSave the provided HTML code as index.html in a folder on your computer.Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.Project DocumentationFor Software:Screenshots (Add at least 3)A full-page view of the website's main content area.The custom alert modal and semi-transparent overlay active when the mouse moves.The 'Activate Audio' button before being clicked, showing audio is pending.DiagramsThis diagram shows the main event flow: mousemove -> trigger alert/overlay/sound -> timed hide.For Hardware:Schematic & Circuit![Circuit](sry dont have)Add caption explaining connections![Schematic](sry dont have)Add caption explaining the schematicBuild Photos![Components](sry dont have) List out all components shown![Build](sorry dont have) Explain the build steps![Final](sry dont have) Explain the final buildProject DemoVideo[sry dont have] A short video demonstrating the cursor movement triggering the visual flash, alert pop-up, and frog sound.Additional Demos[Add any extra demo materials/links]Team ContributionsAI Assistant: Developed the core HTML structure, integrated Tailwind CSS for styling, implemented JavaScript logic for cursor detection, alert management, and audio integration using Tone.js, and prepared all README documentation.[Alwin C Varghese]: [the main coder]Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è at TinkerHub Useless Projects
