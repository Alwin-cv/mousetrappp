Project Description
This project is a playful, intentionally disruptive web application designed to demonstrate immediate visual and auditory feedback based on cursor movement. It makes sure you're always aware of your digital actions!

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Modern web browsing is far too calm and predictable. Users need a constant, engaging reminder that their cursor is, indeed, moving, to prevent them from slipping into digital complacency.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
By integrating a full-screen flash, a persistent pop-up alert, and a delightful frog croak on every single mouse movement, we ensure the user is perpetually aware of their subtle digital actions, thus eliminating the "problem" of overly smooth online experiences.
